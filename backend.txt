INTRODUCTION TO NODE.JS
- Created in 2009 by Ryan Dahi
- created to fix limitations to traditional web servers
Problems such as memory issues, time it takes to fetch data i.e (read and write operations) etc
- Reason why Asynchronous operation was developed

KEY REASONS TO USE NODE.JS
- Javascript Everywhere: You don't have to change to a new language
- Asynchronous operation: Helps to handle multiple task simultaneously
- Rich Ecosystem: One get enough help online
- Scalable
- 
ASYNCHRONOUS NATURE OF NODE.JS
-This is simply means the ability to perform talk simultaneously

BASIC NODE.JS CONCEPTS
- Node js is like a tool box, it contains several tools to build application like Javascript.
- modules:- Reuseable pieces of codes. is used to orgnaize code in different pieces
- Event driven:- (for example use state in fronent). allows to handle multiple operations
npm (node package manager(tool box)):- Helps to install and  manage libraries
- Node Js saves time and effort

SETTING NODE.JS ENVIRONMENT
-Download Node
- install Node
- Verify installation (node --verion)

30/04/2024 EXPRESS JS
- It is used specifically for making building web application easy
- Express.js is made from NodeJs

-intitialize node js by (npm init -Y)
- install node js (npm i express) 

CREATING ROUTES AND HANDLING HTTPS REQUEST
ROUTES are paths to handle request and responses
-HTTPS request are more like visiting a website in your browser
- HTTP response is what you get back from the servers

TYPES OF HTTP REQUEST
- GET - data from the server is fetched with this request
-POST- used to submit data to the server
- PUT - to update resourceon the server
- DELETE - to delete resource from the server

ANATOMY OF HTTP REQUEST
- URL - Helps to specify the address of the resource you want to access
- METHOD - specifies the type of request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Headers - additional information about the request e.g content-type
- BODY: Contains the data to be sent to the server (JSON etc)

HANDLING HTTP REQUEST IN WEB APPLICATION

INSTALLATION

insomnia api testing
npm install cors:- 
CROSS ORIGIN REQUESTS:- Helps to access control origin, it's like a mediator
between two browsers. cross is like a security feature . it is to prevent user'saves
cors is used to interact with the backend; to make request
A policy/rule that checks for a request. trying to make a request between two origins(CORS)
npm i react-router-dom
install on frontend folder:- npm install --save react-toastify

material ui for design templates the library must be installed 
inother to make use of it

npm install bcrypt-  for authentication
npm install jsonwebtoken - to be installed at the backend
